          Brief History of Muhammadiyah University of Tangerang On June 1, 1993,
          STIE Muhammadiyah Tangerang was established, which is one of the
          charitable enterprises owned by the Muhammadiyah organization under
          the auspices of the Muhammadiyah Higher Education Research and
          Development Council (DIKTILITBANG) based on the Decree of the
          Muhammadiyah Regional Leadership of DKI Jakarta No. 1.A/SK/B/1992
          dated November 10, 1992. Over time, the establishment of STAI
          Muhammadiyah Tangerang in 2000 followed, then STIKES Muhammadiyah
          Tangerang was established again in 2004. The three Muhammadiyah
          charitable enterprises are under the auspices and owned by the
          Muhammadiyah Regional Leadership of Tangerang City.
        </p>
        <p>
          With the demands of an increasingly competitive era, the Muhammadiyah
          Regional Leadership Conference of Tangerang City for the 2005-2010
          period recommended the establishment of the Muhammadiyah University of
          Tangerang. This idea has certainly been considered on the basis that
          Muhammadiyah's Charity in Tangerang City has quite a large potential
          to be developed. In addition, there is an agreement between the
          leaders of the three existing Muhammadiyah Colleges to join in
          establishing UMT. The three institutions are STIEM, STAIM and STIKES
          Muhammadiyah. After going through a very long process, finally the
          Proposal to establish UMT received a positive response from the
          Minister of National Education and on August 3, 2009, the Decree of
          the Minister of National Education of the Republic of Indonesia Number
          109/D/0/2009 concerning the UMT Operational Permit was born. Based on
          the Decree, UMT has had several new study programs resulting from a
          visitation by the Directorate General of Higher Education, National
          Education Office. The study programs include:
